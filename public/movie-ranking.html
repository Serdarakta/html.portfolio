<h1>MY BEST MOVİES ACCORDİNG TO ME</h1>
<h2>TOP MOVİES FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>This movie is the number one to watch for me. I am still in the effect of thid movie.
    The people, the scenes, the incident etc. all worked so well for a smooth watching experince.
    Lastly I would say you are gonna miss so much if you die without watching this movie.

<h3>The Walking Dead</h3>
<p> I guess the underlying reason behind why I liked this movie so much is its totally made up with a idea
    which I always dreamt of as a kid. Also I repeat in every movie review the scenes are way much important 
    when I watch a movie and I would say this movie has the best graphipcs and themes when it comes to scene quality.
    To lastly mention I suppose I like to see blood and violent against the enemy of human being.

<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>This movie is created by illustrating the life of Vikings whose lived once upon a time in 
    the terrorities like Norway, Denmark. The most attractive part of the movie was the lifestyle 
    of these people. They believe in several god and a place called Vallaha, to enter to Vallaha they try to 
    conquire new kingdoms and have a reputation amongst the people. They are warriors and I mostly like 
    watching war with the swords and shields actually it reminds me of my ancestors and take me to a history
    travel. My favorite character was Ragnar.
